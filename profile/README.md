## Hi there üëã, AC MADD 2025 students!

# README
This is the after school project practice group for Algonquin Colledge MADD 2025 students.   
This is an inoffical group self orgnized by students.  
We accept all the students who want to join.  
You may consider this as your side project, or you may have your own side project and have some practice here also, and you may fork the project here to start your own side project.  
We choose MIT license for all the projects, which means the least restrictions for all the codes assets here: Anyone can share, fork, sublicense those projects.  

## Why after school projects
```
It was the worst of times. It was the best of timesÔºÅ  
```  
Due to the poor economic employment environment and the challenges that the AI brings to the industry, we believe that MADD students need to put in extra effort to be ready to enter the industry.  

## What expect from this group project
Is that possible to get more from these 2 years?  
1. It may let us have a better prepare to get the knowledge from school courses.
2. It may let us have a better understand what we learn from school courses, and have a chance to practice by group.
   Now the job market is like a wall, there is few chance for fresh junior engineer, but some of the chance for 3 years experience engineers. To have a chance to get a better position to go into this industry.

## pre-projects requirements
It is better to have below knowledge before start a fullstack project, those requirements comes from the job marketing analysis, but it is hard to have everybody to get all the skills ready soon:    
1. Web Dev basic tools: HTML, CSS, [Javascript](https://javascript.info/js), then [React](https://react.dev/learn).
2. Git and github basic kowledge: [How to creating branches, commits, and pull requests](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
3. [Communicate using Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)
4. Database knowledge.
5. Unit, Syste test, CI/CD, Container and K8s.

So we are going to start with some basic content, to help everybody get ready soon.

## Next Plan (TBD)
1. Let's start from analysing indeed/linkedin Job Description, to understand what kind of tool sets need to be ready 2 years later.
2. The understanding about the knowledge structure to be a fullstack engineer.
3. Practice git & github
4. Practice html, css, javascript
5. understand HTTP protocal
6. Data structure & Algrithm
7. what is backend/frontend, what is javascript web frameworks - we may start coding from here, below knowledge is not core content
8. Mobile dev
9. React
10. database & SQL
11. Unit test
12. CI/CD
13. Linux & Container, k8s

## Group plan
It is better to have a 10 hours/week plan for each member on this group, and 30 - 60 minutes face 2 face meeting per week.  
It is better to have different roles for each project, and let everybody to have a chance to try the role they want to be.   
such as project manager, UI/UX design, frontend engineer, backend engineer, Devops engineer etc.

## Project AI policy
AI will be our the most important topic during the next 2 years.  
We are going to build AI Agent tools and We highly recommend practice coding with AI's help.   
But since the target of the projects here is practicing, we do not recommend to use AI to generate everything*[1].  
You are responsible for the quality of your code.  
If you are going to generate some code by AI, it is better to review the code by yourself first, and run the test to make sure it works.  
Also we still need to review the code for each other before push/merge to the main branch, it is still the good way to control the production quality and to learn coding.  
  
*[1] Currently, there is no AI agent production & industry environment ready for total automatic/vibe coding scenario, if some day it really comes, which means no humen coding needed, then our learning story would be totally different
