## Hi there üëã

# README
This is the after school project ideas for Algonquin Colledge MADD 2025 students.   
We accept all the students who want to join this after school project.  
We choose MIT license for all the projects, which means the least restrictions for all the codes assets here: Anyone can share, fork, sublicense those projects.  

## Why after school projects
```
It was the worst of times. It was the best of timesÔºÅ  
```  
Due to the poor economic employment environment and the challenges that the AI brings to the industry, we believe that MADD students need to put in extra effort to be ready to enter the industry.  

## pre-projects requirements
It is better to have below knowledge before start the project, but you don't have to be the expert, we are going to practice it here:    
1. Web Dev basic tools: HTML, CSS, [Javascript](https://javascript.info/js), then [React](https://react.dev/learn).
2. Git and github basic kowledge: [How to creating branches, commits, and pull requests](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
3. [Communicate using Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)
4. Database knowledge.

## Project AI policy
We are going to use AI to help us coding, but since the target of the projects here is practicing, we do not recommend to use AI to generate everything.  
It is better to do the system design, coding by yourself. If you are going to generate some code by AI, it is better to review the code by yourself first, and run the test to make sure it works.  
Also we still need to review the code for each other, it is still the good way to learn coding.
