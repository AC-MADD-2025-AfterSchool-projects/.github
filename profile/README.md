## Hi there üëã, AC MADD 2025 students!

# Side Project Club

## Who we are
This is the side project club for Algonquin Colledge MADD 2025 Fall students.   
This is an inoffical group self orgnized by students.  

## Club members
We accept all the students who want to join.  
You may consider the projects and the ideas here as your own start, and fork it as your own side project.
We choose MIT license for all the projects, which means the least restrictions for all the codes assets here: Anyone can share, fork, sublicense those projects.  

Organizer: Jimmy Z. (zhan0963@algonquin)  
I have some web development experience, but I'm not proficient in it yet.   
And I haven't had the opportunity to build a production-ready application.  
  
There are lots of content need to learn in MADD, maybe the course content itself has already exhausted us.  
But I still hope to make the most of the next 20 months to practice my skills.  
If you have a similar feeling, let's join this club.

## How to join this club
Join the Slack channel: [sideproject-club-inofficial](https://f25-maddstart.slack.com/archives/C09CPEGGAPL)  
Join the github Organization: [AC-MADD2025Fall-SideProject-club](https://github.com/AC-MADD-2025-AfterSchool-projects)  
Join discussions and weekly meeting  
Join the project to start coding!  

## Why side projects
We want to practice more!
```
It was the worst of times. It was the best of timesÔºÅ  
```
Now the job market is like a wall, there is few chance for fresh junior engineer, but some of the job opening for 3 years experience engineers.   
We want to have a better position to go into this industry.
And due to the poor economic employment environment and the challenges that the AI brings to the industry, we believe that MADD students need to put in extra effort to be ready to enter the industry.    
  
We hope that we can run it as a real business development team.

## What expect from this group project
Is that possible to get more from the next 20 months?  
Are you going to be ready to go into the job marketing after that?    
  
1. It may let us have a better prepare to get the knowledge from school courses.
2. It may let us have a better understand what we learn from school courses, and have a chance to practice by group.
3. It may let us have a chance to resolve real world problems by different thinking and culture.

## What skill do we need to join the group
We welcome everyone to join without any background knowledge. But, some of the projects need some design/tech backgrounds.
If you consider it is not fit you, you may join as a oberver roles to stay in the project, until you can deliver some functions.  
It may have more than 1 project on going in this group, and everyone can choose the one you like to join.

Some of below skills/tools would be the essential/core tools:
1. Git and github
2. HTML, CSS, Javascript
3. Markdown
4. Frontend/Backend framework knowledge

### Ref Link
1. Web Dev basic tools: HTML, CSS, [Javascript](https://javascript.info/js), then [React](https://react.dev/learn).
2. Git and github basic kowledge: [How to creating branches, commits, and pull requests](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
3. [Communicate using Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)
4. Database knowledge.
5. Unit, Syste test, CI/CD, Container and K8s.

We are going to have a weekly meeting to share some topics, ideas, progress.

## Next Plan/topics ideas (TBD)
1. Job marketing analysis, start from analysing indeed/linkedin Job Description, to understand what kind of tool sets need to be ready, the understanding about the knowledge structure to be a fullstack engineer.
2. System design practice (for example: how to desgin a assiment deadline auto management/reminder system, how to design your own AI Agent)
3. Practice git & github, html, css, javascript - what we are learning right now.
4. Data structure & Algrithm - it is better to understanding that all the application programming is about operating data efficiently
5. what is backend/frontend, what is javascript web frameworks - we may start coding from here, below knowledge is not the starting blocker
6. understanding HTTP protocal
7. Mobile dev
8. database & SQL
9. Unit test
10. CI/CD, Container, k8s etc.

## Group plan
It is better to have a 10 hours weekly time for each member in this group, and 30 - 60 minutes face 2 face group meeting per week.  
(It seems like Thursday 3pm - 4pm in WT127 is a good choice since we have the WT127 lab at that time, or we need book a meeting room)
It is better to have different roles for each project, and let everybody to have a chance to try the role they want to be.   
such as project manager, UI/UX design, frontend engineer, backend engineer, Devops engineer etc.

## Project AI policy
AI will be our the most important topic during the next 2 years.  
We are going to build AI Agent tools and We highly recommend practice coding with AI's help.   
But since the target of the projects here is practicing, we do not recommend to use AI to generate everything*[1].  
You are responsible for the quality of your code.  
If you are going to generate some code by AI, it is better to review the code by yourself first, and run the test to make sure it works.  
Also we still need to review the code for each other before push/merge to the main branch, it is still the good way to control the production quality and to learn coding.  
  
*[1] Currently, there is no AI agent production & industry environment ready for total automatic/vibe coding scenario, if some day it really comes, which means no humen coding needed, then our learning story would be totally different

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
